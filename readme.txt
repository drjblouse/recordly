The current state of the application is what I could complete in 1 hour as
requested.

Notes: Since I started with the backend, the server side is much more
complete than the angular single page application. If I could start over I
would likely start with angular failing tests instead of the same
on the backend. I typically develop using a test driven approach. I like
to begin with tests for the application to assist in the overall design. I
am much faster writing backend code which is why I started on the server. I
figured I would be able to get closer to completion and show more of my
development skill and tdd process with a heavier server. I wanted to
try to use a new technology like Meteor JS but did not have the time due to the
holidays so I stuck with what I know well.

Next Steps (Not necessarily in order):
- Add the search to the ui and REST service.
- Add validation in the UI
- Add the missing screens to the UI.
- Get higher coverage on UI testing
- Refactor the models and serializers to match the needs of the application.
- Secure the backend and enforce the token based login which I disabled to get
the client wired up correctly.
